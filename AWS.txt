Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

3 Types of Cloud Computing

Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS)
You manage the server which can be physical or virtual, as well as the operating system. Usually, Data centre provider will have no access to the server.

Platform As A Service (PAAS )
Someone else manages the underlying hardware and operating systems. You just focus on your applications.

Software As A Service (SAAS)
Think of Gmail. All you manage is your inbox (or the software provided to you by Google). Google take care of the data centers, servers, networks, storage, maintenance, patching etc.

EC2

EC2, or Elastic Compute Cloud, is a fundamental service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's essentially a web service that allows users to rent virtual servers, known as instances, in the cloud. These instances provide scalable compute capacity, which means you can easily scale up or down based on your application's needs without the hassle of maintaining physical hardware.
EC2 instances are like virtual machines that run a variety of operating systems, including Linux and Windows. They are designed to handle a wide range of computing workloads, from simple web hosting to complex applications that require substantial computational power.

Key Features:
Hosting Applications
Scalability

LAMBDA
Lambda." It's a powerful and serverless compute service provided by Amazon that allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
AWS Lambda enables developers to build applications and services by running code in response to events. These events can include changes to data in Amazon S3 buckets, updates to a database, HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway, or custom events generated by other AWS services. With AWS Lambda, developers can write code in various programming languages (like Python, Node.js, Java, etc.) and have it automatically scaled and executed based on the incoming events.
